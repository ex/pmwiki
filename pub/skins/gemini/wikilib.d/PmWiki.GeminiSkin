text=Gemini is a "skin" created for PmWiki by Hans Bracker. Maybe "face" would be a better name, since it is what you are facing here: the appearance in form of colours, fonts and borders used, the specific layout of the page and its navigational aids, and the functionality of buttons and links employed therein.%0a%0a`Gemini can show many different faces, and it is highly customisable and changable in its looks and functions. If [[Site/Style Options]] are enabled you can choose from a number of styles for colours, fonts and layouts, for your own use, without affecting others.%0a%0a`Gemini is under constant development. You can find detailed information on the Pmwiki website at [[Cookbook:GeminiSkin]] or the author's website at [[http://softflow.co.uk/design|softflow.co.uk]].%0a%0a'''Version: {$SkinVersion}'''
